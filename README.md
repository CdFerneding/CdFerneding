### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am Conrad Ferneding, a student at the TH Brandenburg in Germany, Brandenburg. I've just finished my exchange semester in Norway and am currently trying to widen my knowledge about cybersecurity through ctf events. I am trying to fasten my already existingn knowledge through leetcode.  

ðŸŽ¸ Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **sports: running, snowboarding**, **reading** and **programming: game-programming**.
