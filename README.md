### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am Conrad Ferneding, a student at the TH Brandenburg in Germany, Brandenburg. I've just finished my exchange semester in Norway and I am currently trying to widen my knowledge about cybersecurity through ctf (capture the flag) events. I hope that I will be able to work in cybersecurity. I am trying to secure my already existing programming knowledge through leetcode.  

I am also interested in creating my own game in the future as I like to play games myself.  

ðŸŽ¸ Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies are snowboarding, reading, playing the piano and accordeon and listening to music.
